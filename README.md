## About
This mod is a library that provides common code between tnoctua's mods.  By itself the mod is inert and requires dependant(s) to function.

## To Developers
You are welcome to use or fork this library.  I develop this mod primarily to reduce copy-paste between my mods and to reduce the memory cost of running them.  It is sufficient for simple things that most mods need to do such as registering blocks, handling configuration files, data generation, etc.
